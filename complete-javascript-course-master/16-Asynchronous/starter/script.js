// this is the old school way of doing AJAX in JavaScript. But I'm still showing it to you for two reasons. So first, I want you to know that XML HTTP requests exists, because you might actually need it in the future. And second, I want to show you how AJAX calls used to be handled with events and callback functions. And so only after that we should move on to a more modern way of handling asynchronous JavaScript, which is gonna be a feature called Promises.

// Now, the problem with callback hell is that it makes our code look very messy. But even more important, it makes our code harder to maintain, and very difficult to understand, and to reason about, and code that is hard to understand and difficult to reason about.

// -------------------------CONSUMING PROMISES-------------------------
// Now, of course, at a certain point the promise will then be settled and either in a fulfilled or in a rejected state, but for now let's assume success. So assume that the promise will be fulfilled and that we have a value available to work with. And so to handle this fulfilled state, we can use the then method that is available on all promises. So just like this. So again, this here will return a promise. And on all promises, we can call the then method. Now into the then method, we need to pass a callback function that we want to be executed as soon as the promise is actually fulfilled. So as soon as the result is available.
const getCountryData = function (country) {

    // the type of this response object is also called response
    // in order to read the data of this response we need to call json method..
  });
};

// So a function and then this function will actually receive one argument once it's called by JavaScript and that argument is the resulting value of the fulfilled promise. So let me call it response here because this is the response of an AJAX call in this case.
